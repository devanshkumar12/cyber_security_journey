# cyber_security_journey
This repository begins my cybersecurity journey, documenting concepts, labs, and tools as I learn from basics to advanced. It includes notes on networking, OSI/TCP models, IP, MAC, ports, and practical exercises with tools like Nmap, Wireshark, and Metasploit. A timeline of learning, practice, and growth.
